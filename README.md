String Compress
---------------

**strcompress** folder is about a google interview question I've seen many people talking about in many web site and forums.
The problem to solve is : **Compress string "aabcaaaaade" to "aabc5xade". Only compress if it shortens the string. 5xa means char a is repeated 5 times**

I took about a half hour at work during my launch time to write and test two solutions:

  * The first one **str_compress** uses no specific python module, and only nativ e builtins
  * The second one **str_compress_re** uses python re module.

At the time of this first commit I didn't yet benckmark the two solutions ecution time, so feel free to do it. I tried to compress special french characters in the example of the second solution, but it doesn't work in this first commit ;)

Any coding mistake or advises are well come !!!
